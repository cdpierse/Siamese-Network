# Specification 
- design a CLI method for creating a file/index of pairs and non pairs. This index file should be created for both a train, test, and validaton set of data. Rather than create sub folders of files, it should merely point to unique files. 
- create a dataloading class using pytorch that correctly loads image pairs and their accompanying labels for the network. May need to create multiple data loader for train and test. 
- design network in pytorch, experiment with finetuning the images on a pretrained image network.
