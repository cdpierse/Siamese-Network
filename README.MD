# Siamese Network (WIP)
This repo contains a pytorch implementation of a siamese network for facial recognition. 

This kind of learning is also known as one-shot learning as the model is trained so that it can predict if two images of faces are the same person without off a single reference image of that person, it does not need many examples.
